# Thoughts
1) Iterative Hill Climbing... what are the impacts of this? Remember to do tie breaking, else will continually test same branches
2) Mutability of objects, better to not deepcopy and just overwrite the object? Is this true? Discuss
3) [Optimisation of Algorithm](https://hexadix.com/hard-sudoku-solver-algorithm-part-2/)
4) [Analysis of Results (plots etc)](https://norvig.com/sudoku.html)
